I'm Thomas, a PhD candidate at the University of Cambridge researching quantum light sensors. I'm supervised by [Prof. Louise Hirst](https://www.phy.cam.ac.uk/profile/prof-louise-hirst/) from Cambridge and [Mark Stevenson](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DR9KmDwAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) from [Toshiba](https://www.toshiba.eu/quantum/), with whom I work to develop sensors for next-gen quantum technologies.

Previously, I compeleted my MPhys degree at the University of Bath, graduating with First-class honours.
