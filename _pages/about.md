I'm Thomas, a first-year PhD candidate at the University of Cambridge researching quantum light sensors. I'm supervised by [Prof. Louise Hirst](https://www.phy.cam.ac.uk/profile/prof-louise-hirst/) from Cambridge and [Mark Stevenson](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DR9KmDwAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) from [Toshiba](https://www.toshiba.eu/quantum/), with whom I work to develop sensors for next-gen quantum technologies. I am a Darwin College Member and am co-funded by Toshiba and the Cambridge Nanoscience CDT.

My current affiliations include:
 - Toshiba Research Europe - Quantum Devices team
 - Quantum Enabled Position, Navigation and Timing Hub ([QEPNT](https://www.qepnt.org/))
 - Cambridge Nanoscience Doctoral Training Centre ([NanoDTC](https://www.nanodtc.cam.ac.uk/))

Previously, I completed my MPhys degree at the University of Bath, graduating with First-class honours in 2025.
