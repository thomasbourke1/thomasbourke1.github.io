I attended the National Quantum Hackathon this year run by the [NQCC](https://www.nqcc.ac.uk/), which was held at the University of Edinburgh. Team Superposition and I (pictured below) tackled the problem **Modelling Surface Interactions of Hydrogen for Aerospace**, assigned by Rolls-Royce plc. It was a fantastic learning and networking opportunity, and I really enjoyed visiting Edinburgh again.
